# How to install my software

I would like to mention this installation process does take quite some time, but once this is done it is done. The only thing you will be to install is my new software file and that is only when I update my software. 

1. You will need to install the Eclipse IDE for Eclispe Committer's, don't install the nomral Eclispe IDE as this project is a plugin development project, meaning that in order to run my code you have to have a plugin project.

2. The whole premise of this project is to generate random test data and format it in JUnit format. So in order for you to be able to run the test or tests that are generated, you will have to install a plugin on the Eclipse marketplace. To install this plugin go to, On the top of your Eclipse go to - Help - Eclipse Marketplace. Then you will just search for "JUnit Tools 4 Spring" then just follow the on screen instructions to install this software to be able to run the generated tests.

3. In order for you to be able to run my software, you are going to need to install some dependencies, here are the dependencies you will need to install, __org.eclipse.jdt.core__, __org.eclipse.ui__, __org.eclipse.core.runtime__, __org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor__, __org.eclipse.jface.text__, __org.junit_ and the final dependencie you will be is, __junit.jupiter-api__. 

4. You are going to also need to install some extentions, here are the extentions you will need to install, __org.eclipse.ui.commands__, __org.eclipse.ui.handlers__ and finally, __org.eclipse.ui.menus__

5. Finally the last step, this step involves you to install my jar file, this very important because the jar file is needed to run my software on another machine.

# How to operate my software
1. The jar file that you have downlaoded from my repository you are going to need to do the following. You need to go to your File Explorer - C: - Users - "Your Name" - eclipse - the committers folder - eclipse, then you need to put the jar file into the "dropins" and "plugins" folder.

2. If you have your Eclispe open and running where you have just put in the jar file, you will need to restart your eclipse.
